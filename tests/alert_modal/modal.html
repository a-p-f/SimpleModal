<p>This is an alert-style modal. Ensure that it animates in nicely on the first load.</p>

<!-- Note - Safari seems to focus [autofocus] elements, even though this is an iframe. That broke our entrance animation on another site, but we haven't yet been able to replicate it here. This autofocus element _may_ not break the entrance animation in Safari, but that doesn't mean it will always work. Seems to depend on page structure. -->
<p>Note - Safari seems to focus autofocus elements, even though this is an iframe, and that can break animations: <input autofocus></p>

<p>Note - this input is here because the presence of an input seems to break animations in Safari, under certain circumstances: <input name=""></p>

<p>Ensure that when you <a autofocusOFF href="?PAGE_2">click here</a>, the window navigates (the QS below should change), and ensure that the window does NOT re-animate.</p>
<p>QS: <output id="querystring"></output></p>
<script>
    document.getElementById('querystring').innerText = location.search;

<button onclick="SimpleModal.close();">Close</button>
